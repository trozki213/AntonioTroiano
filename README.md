💼 Selected Projects: 

📰 Fake News Detection via Text Vectorization — Built and evaluated machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest) for fake-news classification. Applied TF-IDF and Bag-of-Words vectorization to capture linguistic and semantic patterns in news datasets.
🧬 Gene Expression & Hypoxia Classification — EDA + PCA + clustering + ML (RF, SVM, MLP) on single-cell RNA-seq data to classify hypoxic vs normoxic cells
❤️ Heart Attack Risk Study (India) — Statistical modeling and data-driven insights on cardiovascular disease risk factors.
📊 ML Algorithm Comparison — Evaluated Logistic Regression vs k-NN (EDA, scaling, hyperparameter tuning) on a 1.4k-sample dataset.
🚜 Autoencoder-based Onboard Image Segmentation — Designed and trained a convolutional autoencoder for semantic segmentation of rural onboard images into 8 terrain classes, evaluated using mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU).
🤖 Towards More Realistic Neural Networks (ML Research) — Theoretical ML project studying partially symmetric random connectivity and sparse excitatory couplings to model biologically plausible cortical networks.
