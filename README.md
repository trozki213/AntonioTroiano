## 🚀 Projects
- **AI/ML Research** → Contributing to research projects in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, exploring advanced models and interdisciplinary applications.  
- **Statistical Study on Heart Attacks in India** → Data-driven analysis of the rising incidence of cardiovascular diseases among young adults. Investigated lifestyle and behavioral risk factors and evaluated possible mitigations using statistical methods.  
- **Gene Expression & Hypoxia Classification** → Analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets (MCF7 luminal and HCC1806 basal breast cancer cell lines, SMART-seq & DROP-seq). Applied PCA and clustering to study cell separation under hypoxic vs normoxic conditions. Built supervised pipelines (Random Forest, SVM, k-NN, Logistic Regression, MLP) with cross-validation, feature selection, and cross-dataset generalization. Identified consensus gene panels and trained champion models for external blind evaluation.  
- **Logistic Regression vs k-Nearest Neighbors** → Comparative study of two classical ML algorithms on a dataset of 1400 samples with 30 features. Includes EDA, correlation and distribution analysis, scaling, train/test split, baseline evaluation, hyperparameter tuning with visualization, and final model selection. Highlights trade-offs between simplicity, interpretability, and performance.
