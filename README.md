## 🚀 Projects
- **AI/ML Research** → Contributing to interdisciplinary research projects in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, exploring innovative architectures and optimization methods.  
- **Statistical Study on Heart Attacks in India** → Data-driven analysis of the rising incidence of cardiovascular diseases among young adults. Investigated lifestyle and behavioral risk factors and proposed statistical mitigations.  
- **Gene Expression & Hypoxia Classification** → Applied PCA, clustering, and supervised ML (Random Forest, SVM, k-NN, Logistic Regression, MLP) to single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Identified consensus gene panels and trained champion models for hypoxia vs normoxia classification.  
- **Logistic Regression vs k-Nearest Neighbors** → Comparative study of two classical ML algorithms on a dataset of 1400 samples with 30 features. Included EDA, scaling, hyperparameter tuning, and final evaluation to highlight trade-offs between interpretability and performance.
